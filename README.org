* oatmeal

An opinionated(*) tool for working with Common Lisp projects.

Because I can't get my head around some of the others.

(*) (Probably /wrong/ opinions...)

** Building

(On MacOS; your mileage may vary on other platforms.) First install Java and [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]].

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ make
$ make install
#+END_SRC

$ java -jar ~/bin/oatmeal.jar
#+END_SRC

Or, add the following to your shell profile:

#+END_SRC

And then just type =oatmeal= to invoke the command.
